## Laravel 12 Best Practices Implemented

1. **Proper Eloquent Relationships** - HasMany, BelongsTo relationships properly defined
2. **Mass Assignment Protection** - Fillable arrays defined for security
3. **Attribute Casting** - Proper casting for dates, decimals, JSON
4. **Query Scopes** - Reusable query scopes for common filters
5. **Validation Rules** - Comprehensive validation with Laravel's validation rules
6. **HTTP Status Codes** - Proper HTTP response codes
7. **Resource Relationships** - Eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
8. **Foreign Key Constraints** - Proper cascade and restrict constraints
9. **Database Indexes** - Strategic indexes for performance
10. **Route Model Binding** - Implicit model binding in controllers

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run Migrations:**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

2. **Seed Data** (if needed):
   Create seeders for initial billing plans and sample businesses

3. **API Routes:**
   Add routes to your `routes/api.php` file for all controllers

4. **Authentication:**
   Add authentication middleware to protect business panel endpoints

## Security Considerations

- All controllers include proper validation
- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
- Unique constraints on critical fields (SKU, subscription per business)
- Soft deletes can be added if needed
- Rate limiting should be implemented for API endpoints

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a B2B business panel with comprehensive functionality for managing businesses, products, promotions, analytics, and subscriptions.
